  "readme": "# styles for Respoke web properties\n\nThis repo has shared styles for Respoke websites.\n\n```bash\n# this format tells NPM to use github.com/respoke/style\nnpm i --save-dev respoke/style\n```\n\n## Stylesheet usage\n\nSee `SampleGruntfileUsage.js` for building the stylesheet.\n\nRecommended usage is from your own `.scss` stylesheet file:\n\n```scss\n@import '../node_modules/respoke-style/styles/base.scss';\n\n/* Now use the styles */\n\n```\n\n## Jade template usage\n\nInside your local Jade template:\n\n```jade\ndoctype html\nhtml\n    head\n        include ../node_modules/respoke-style/head.jade\n    body\n        include ../node_modules/respoke-style/navbar.jade\n\n        p Some custom paragraph text\n\n        include ../node_modules/respoke-style/footer.jade\n```\n\n## Assets\n\nThese are files you may want to reuse. You will probably want to copy them during your build. See\nthe example Gruntfile `copy` task.\n\n`./assets/`\n`./assets/images/`\n`./assets/js/`\n\n## Exported paths\n\nSee the list of exported asset paths in `./index.js`.\n\nYou can use these paths as local variables for your SCSS and Jade, or in your build script. See the\nexample Gruntfile.\n\n## Your project structure\n\nWhen you copy the `./assets` to your local project, you must serve the `./assets/js/` folder at\nthe root of your website such that it is at the `/js/` path (required by `./templates/head.jade`).\n\n\n## Example Gruntfile\n\nSee `./SampleGruntfileUsage.js` for an example of building the Respoke styles into one of your projects.\n",
